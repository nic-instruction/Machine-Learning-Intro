        "## Finding Accurate Information\n",
        "   * Most of the notebooks shared on Kaggle and on the internet  will be wrong, contain incorrect information, and should not be relied on for accurate information.  Even if you find the same info in 10 places, that doesn’t make it accurate.  This is a new field and there’s a lot of misinformation.  \n",
        "   * The official Kaggle material will be good, and generally all the winners of the contests will be good.\n",
        "   * At least 25% of the good code will be a direct cp/paste job from Jason Brownly’s website.  This is a great resource, it’s also linked in the notes I gave you https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/ and you should know his code when you see it, also use this to look up any questions you have.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tutorials Make it Easy, This is Really Hard\n",
        "* These tutorials start you out with clean datasets and heavily imply that the only problems you will run into will be data not being filled in.  Real world data will be very different.  You’ll have different datatypes, different entry styles, anything that can go wrong, will go wrong, you’re gonna need to learn some data cleaning skills.  Luckily, there’s another tutorial just for that.  See below!\n",
        "* There are also A TON of different algorythms to learn, so take a look at them and what they do.\n",
        "* We haven't even touched deep learning yet, which is where the show really gets started.  That's what the book is about, and that's the thing that is being called 'AI'.\n",
        "* The competitions are a good way to learn this stuff.  Pick one you're interested in and take the tutorials you need to compelte it.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Down the Road\n",
        "* You will hit a barrier at some point, if you do this regularly, where you need to understand how these things actually work.  When that happens, read the book.  The book will not teach you the math, to understand the math, you need to take linear algebra (which, believe me, taking it with some sort of use case is the only way to do it, unless you really love math).\n",
        "* When you hit that barrier, you should also look at the handout I gave you in more depth."
