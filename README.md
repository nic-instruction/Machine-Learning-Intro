# Machine-Learning-Intro
This repo holds resources for the Machine Learning club I teach/ lead.  Feel free to duplicate and disseminate parts of this curriculum, or this curriculum in full, but credit me and this repo with anything you copy directly, please.

Note: I have written the intro and the strategy in colab notebooks. Check out Intro_To_Machine_Learning.ipynb and ML_Club_Learning_Strategy.ipynb. 

ML_Club_Learning_Strategy.ipynb is a coding sample you can play with. It is a basica implementation from one of the Google tutorials linked here.
