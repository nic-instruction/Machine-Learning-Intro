If you can, make useful suggestions to people already in the field (this can be tricky, don't tell them something they already know, because they'll get mad at you, but listen hard, and you can always preface your suggestions with 'I'm sure you've already tried this, but...').  Be humble and helpful.  You want them to see a smart, easy-to-work-with person who may not have all the skills yet, but is just going to eat them up when you're put on an ML team.

If you've gotten an undergraduate degree during this time, you can ask your manager to send you (make sure the company pays for it) to a part-time Master's level applied mathematics program in machine learning.  If you don't have a degree, there will likely be a master's level certificate program you can enter that will teach you the same content (probably in the same class as the master's degree students) and give you a cert.  There are also a number of places you can learn advanced math online, BUT, it won't link you into a cohort (which, if you do it right, will be people you can follow advancements in math and ML with for the rest of your life and learn new techniques from) and it will probably not be up to date.\n",
